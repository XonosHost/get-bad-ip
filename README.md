# get-bad-ip

Runs on a server, gets attacked and records every single IP requesting during the program's running time.

Should not be used to get bad ip addresses on a live server, only a "donor" server that will only have test attacks.

Please make sure you have permission from your hosting company, IXP, ISP, before use.
